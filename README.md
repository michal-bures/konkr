# Konkr

A HTML5 strategy game built with Phaser 2 - play at [https://www.konkr.io/legacy].

This is a javascript game inspired by Sean O'Connor's "Slay". I originally made it in 2016 and made the code open source in 2022.

If you intend to learn from this code, be careful, this was my first HTML5 game nad it was where I learned how to NOT code a game :).

It is the predecessor to [https://www.konkr.io], a game developed with typescript and Phaser 3.
